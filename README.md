Adds Python to the System PATH Environmental Variable


## Featrues
<!------------------------------------------------------->

* Automatic detection of Python installations
* Automatic removal of previous Python installatiosn from PATH


## Usage
<!------------------------------------------------------->

Enter either a valid Python version or a valid path to a Python installation.
  * If your version is Python 2.7.10, you could enter one of the following and the path will automatically be detected.
    * Python 2.7.10
    * Python 2.7
    * Python 27
    * 2.7.10
    * 2.7
    * 27
  * If you installed python at a custom location, such as C:/MySecretLocation/Python, then you would enter the following
    * C:/MySecretLocation/Python

**Important**
If you have a version of Python installed at a __custom location__, its path will not automatically be detected.  If you do not want that version of Python in your PATH, you will have to remove it manually.
