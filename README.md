# Python2Path

Adds Python to the System PATH Environmental Variable.

###[![Download Python2Path](https://jamrizzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/orange_download_button.png)](//jamrizzi.com/market/python2path/)

Python2Path automatically removes all previous paths to Python, so it can also be used to update your PATH if you changed Python versions.

Features
* Automatic detection of Python installations
* Automatic removal of previous Python installatiosn from PATH


## Instructions

1. Download and run the software.  You can get it [HERE](//jamrizzi.com/market/python2path/).

2. Enter either a valid Python version or a valid path to a Python installation.
	* If your version is Python 2.7.10, you could enter one of the following and the path will automatically be detected.
		* Python 2.7.10
		* Python 2.7
		* Python 27
		* 2.7.10
		* 2.7
		* 27
	* If you installed python at a custom location, such as C:/MySecretLocation/Python, then you would enter the following
		* C:/MySecretLocation/Python

**Important**
If you have a version of Python installed at a __custom location__, its path will not automatically be detected.  If you do not want that version of Python in your PATH, you will have to remove it manually.
